                For Mini Project 1 I was in charge of part three of the project. I created a step by step tutorial that
                explains how to set up Git and work with others.
                I explained how to use branching and how to solve merge conflicts to ease the process of working with
                others.

            <p class="lead">
                For Mini Project 2 I worked with my classmate, Haydy Adballa, to create a website collaboratively. The
                skills I
                learned in Mini Project 1 helped in working as a group and I gained new ones after this project. I am
                looking forward to expanding my skills.

            <p class="lead">
                For Mini Project 3 I created a website using Bootstrap, Github and HTML/CSS. The process was fun and a
                lot easier than creating the code from scratch. I am proud to have come a long way from Project 1!
