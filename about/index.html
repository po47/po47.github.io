<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    What if I told you that I can turn unstable situations into formative experiences?
    Financial instability has forced me to live in different countries, different counties, different cities and study
    in different high schools. The lack of stability solidified my adaptability, my easy to get along with personality,
    and my determination to learn. My name is Paulina Candelejo.
    I am a self taught Graphic Designer, a Latina, a proud Newarker and an aspiring UX Designer.

When I am curious or interested in something, I go after it. By doing so, I have gained new skills and strengthened the ones that I already had. For example, when I grew an interest in graphic design, my underfunded high school did not have enough seats or computers to accommodate me. But, I donâ€™t take no for an answer. I taught myself Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Within weeks, I became a graphic designer for three clubs in my high school.

    I was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey and I am the first in my family
    to pursue a higher education in STEM. I am a self taught Graphic Designer, a Latina, a proud Newarker and an
    aspiring UX Designer. I am a Human Computer Interaction major at NJIT('22). I chose to study HCI because I
    wanted a major with a fusion of technology and graphic design. I understand the need for technological
    advancement and I am eager to contribute to that field using my talent in graphic design. I aspire to be a UX
    Designer and redesign outdated
    systems and create new ones to ease the user experience. As the same time I plan on using the knowledge I am going
    to gain over the
    next few years at NJIT to create business models that have social impact in mind. My ultimate goal is to make
    an impact in Latin America. To provide sources of income through employment to historically oppressed communities. I
    believe
    technology is the going to help me make that goal possible.
